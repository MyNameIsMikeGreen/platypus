# How to Contribute
If you would like to contribute to Platypus, you can do so in a few main ways:

* Resolving issues
* Suggesting enhancements
* Identifying bugs
* Sharing knowledge in comments

Project work is managed using [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MyNameIsMikeGreen/platypus/issues). Please take a look at existing issues for anything that you may wish to provide input on. This may be as simple as sharing ideas on approaches, or as complex as actually implementing the solution. Any contribution, regardless of size, is appreciated.

## Resolving Issues
If you identify an existing issue that you would like to tackle, please follow the following process:

1. Assign the issue to yourself
    * If the issue already has an assignee, please do not reassign the issue. Discuss the issue with the current assignee if you have input you would like to share.
2. Fork the repository
3. Create a descriptively-named branch on your fork
4. (If appropriate) Write a test
    * I strongly suggest following TDD when developing.
    * Please write tests in a similar style to those that already exist in the project.
    * Trivial fixes do not need explicit tests in this project - use your own discretion.
5. Write the code
6. Run `./test.sh`
    * See [README.md](README.md) for further instructions.
    * Fix any flagged issues if this script fails.
7. Raise a PR
8. Link the issue to your PR

Your contribution will be reviewed and merged if satisfactory.

## Creating New Issues
If you have identified a bug or you have an idea for a new feature, please create a new issue on the project and appropariately label it as `bug` or `enhancement`. Try to be as descriptive as possible.
